# Fast-calc-for-SARS-CoV-2

To calculate thousands of sequences will take time.
If your new sequence would be inside the existing framework, you can just add yours to the framework.

Here are sample sequences: duplications were removed from the accompanying data sets, 
and many incomplete sequences were also removed. 
By these removals, the routes in Europe became in patches. 
Also, the fourth route from Wuhan (sky-blue) appeared. 
The green dod is the Zhejiang strain, which afterward migrated to Europe. 

To use this codes,

1. align your sequences to the samples. 
  This should be done manually. 
  The extra stretches of N- and C- terminals have to be removed.
  Here I added two samples from Brazil.

2. Make a txt.file that contain yours only.
   ("brazil.txt")
   
3. Run the code. It makes boolean of yours and applies the axis that has been made for the sample sequence.
   Here the Brazil samples were located at the far end of negative PC1.
